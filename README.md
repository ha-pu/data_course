This repository contains a collection of interactive R Markdown lessons designed
to teach data-related topics in an accessible, hands-on way. By using Binder,
educators and learners can easily launch a pre-built, containerized environment
(including RStudio) right from the browser.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following files:

| **Lesson File**            | **Description**                                                                      |

The repository is configured with:

+ **`environment.yml`**: Lists the necessary dependencies to set up the learning
  environment.
+ **`runtime.txt`**: Specifies the runtime version, ensuring the container runs
  with the correct configuration.

## Getting Started

+ **Launch the Environment:** Click the Binder badge at the top of this page to
  initialize your interactive R environment.
